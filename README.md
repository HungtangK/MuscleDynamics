# MuscleDynamics

Upper-limb muscle dynamic model developed by Hungtang Ko and Visak Kumar. 

## Main file description:

#### MuscleTendonUnit.py: 
  - Defining muscle class and muscle dynamics function
#### Parameter.py: 
  - Parameters for the upper-limb muscles and bones including the function that returns the moment arm and muscle length
#### HopperDynamics.py: 
  - For validating against hopper model in MATLAB simulink provided by the course ME8843 wearable robotics at Georgia Tech(instructor: Dr. Gregory S. Sawicki and Dr. Aaron Young)
#### TwoLinkDynamics.py:
  - For validating the two-linkage dynamics and natural frequency
#### MultiMuscleContraction.py:
  - Forward model that calculated the joint motion given the activation levels of the four muscles.S
